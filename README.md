### About Me

I'm passionate about building scalable, user-friendly web applications using Java, Spring Boot, React, and related technologies.
I recently completed my full stack project **[SkyDominance](https://github.com/Yagyik88/SkyDominance)** â€” a private jet & helicopter booking platform â€” where I designed both the frontend and backend with a focus on clean code and great user experience.

I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills in:
- Java 8/11 and Advanced Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA)
- Frontend development with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Database design with PostgreSQL and SQL queries
- Embedded systems basics and autonomous vehicle engineering
